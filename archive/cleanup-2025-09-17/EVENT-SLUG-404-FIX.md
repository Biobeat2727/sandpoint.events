# Event Slug 404 Fix - RESOLVED

## 🚨 Problem Summary
Event detail pages were showing 404 errors when users clicked "View Details" on events, even though the events had valid slugs.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Draft/Published Status
- **34 out of 39 events were saved as drafts** (`published: false`)
- All pages were filtering by `published == true` only
- Events without images were automatically saved as drafts

### Secondary Issues Fixed:
1. **Static Generation**: `fallback: false` prevented new events from generating pages
2. **Query Filtering**: Not all pages were consistently filtering by published status

## ✅ Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. Published 10 Recent Events
**Action**: Used `publish-recent-events.js` to immediately publish today's events
**Result**: 15 total published events (up from 5)

### 2. Fixed Static Generation for New Events
**File**: `pages/events/[slug].js`
- Changed `fallback: false` to `fallback: 'blocking'`
- Enabled ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
- Added proper 404 handling for unpublished events
- Limited pre-generated paths to recent 20 events for performance

### 3. Added Published Filter to All Pages
**Updated Files**:
- `pages/index.js` - Home page events
- `pages/events/index.js` - Events listing
- `pages/events/calendar.js` - Calendar view
- `pages/venues/[slug].js` - Venue event listings
- `pages/events/[slug].js` - Individual event pages

**Change**: All queries now include `&& published == true`

### 4. Modified Upload Behavior for Future Events
**File**: `utils/sanityUploader.js`
- **Before**: Events defaulted to `published: false`, only published if they had images
- **After**: Events default to `published: true` unless flagged for review (`needsReview: true`)

## 🎯 Current Status

### Live Events Available:
- **15 published events** accessible via their slugs
- **24 draft events** (older events, not visible on website)

### Example Working URLs:
- `/events/rock-n-roll-bingo`
- `/events/live-music-with-moneypenny`
- `/events/aaron-foster-mostly-jokes-stand-up-comedy`
- `/events/feel-it-all`
- `/events/opening-day`

### ISR Benefits:
- New events automatically generate pages on first visit
- Pages cache for 60 seconds then revalidate
- No need to rebuild site when adding events

## 🛡️ Prevention Measures

### Automatic Publishing:
- Events now publish by default unless they need review
- Only events with `needsReview: true` remain as drafts
- Image presence no longer affects published status

### Dynamic Page Generation:
- `fallback: 'blocking'` enables on-demand page generation
- Static paths for recent 20 events for performance
- Proper 404s for genuinely missing events

### Consistent Filtering:
- All pages use `published == true` filter
- Unpublished events never accidentally show up
- Clear separation between drafts and live content

## 🚀 Result

**Event detail pages now work perfectly:**
- ✅ All 15 published events have working detail pages
- ✅ New events automatically generate pages without site rebuild
- ✅ Clean 404s for unpublished or missing events
- ✅ ISR provides optimal performance with fresh content

**Future events will:**
- ✅ Automatically publish when uploaded (unless flagged for review)
- ✅ Generate detail pages immediately on first visit
- ✅ Display consistently across all site pages
