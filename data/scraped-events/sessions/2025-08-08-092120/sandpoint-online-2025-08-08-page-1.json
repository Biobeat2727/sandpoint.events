    "description": "Sandpoint on Stage Presents: Criminals Written and directed by Teresa Pesce. In the sparse setting of a government interrogation room, three criminal suspects are interviewed. The professional interrogators must close the gap between suspicion of guilt and certainty of guilt by getting an admission of the crime. Sometimes it's tense and tricky, sometimes it's very funny, but always \"Criminal\" is an evening you'll enjoy! Recommended for audiences over 15. Don't miss it at the Panida Little Theater, 302 N. First Ave. Performances will run this weekend Friday, August 8 thru Sunday, August 10 with return performances next weekend. Get tickets and showtimes at Panida.org/event/criminals",
