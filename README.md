## üîß Event Processing Pipeline

### Current Architecture (Updated August 2025)

The system follows a streamlined **Raw Scraping ‚Üí Event Merging ‚Üí Normalization ‚Üí Review Separation ‚Üí Sanity Upload** pipeline with intelligent data quality controls.

### Available NPM Commands (Recommended)

#### Individual Steps
```bash
npm run scrape:sandpoint          # Scrape Sandpoint Online (paginated)
npm run scrape:schweitzer         # Scrape Schweitzer Mountain  
npm run scrape:eventbrite         # Scrape Eventbrite
npm run events:merge              # Merge scraped events
npm run events:upload             # Upload to Sanity (preview mode)
npm run events:upload:live        # Upload to Sanity (live upload)
```

#### Full Pipeline Options
```bash
npm run events:run                # Full pipeline (scrape + merge + upload)
npm run events:test               # Test mode pipeline
npm run scrape-all                # Legacy full scrape command
```

#### Utility Commands
```bash
npm run events:status             # Check pipeline status
npm run events:help               # Get help
npm run events:clean              # Clean up files
npm run events:enhance            # Enhance images
npm run events:summarize          # Generate summaries
```

### Alternative Direct Commands
```bash
# Individual scrapers
node scrapers/sandpointOnlineScraper.js
node scrapers/eventbriteScraper.js  
node scrapers/schweitzerScraper.js

# Event processing
node utils/eventMerger.js
node utils/realImageDownloader.js
node upload-events-to-sanity.js  # ‚úÖ VERIFIED WORKING
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Use `node upload-events-to-sanity.js` for uploads, NOT `node utils/sanityUploader.js` (that's a utility module).

### Intelligent Event Processing

#### Enhanced Event Schema
The system supports both legacy and enhanced fields:

**Core Fields:**
- `title`, `description`, `venue`, `tags`, `source`
- `startDate`, `endDate` - Specific event date ranges  
- `startTime`, `endTime` - Time strings in 24-hour format ("19:30")
- `referenceUrl` - Original source URL for attribution
- `needsReview` - Boolean flag for incomplete/ambiguous data
- `locationNote` - For ambiguous locations ("Downtown Sandpoint")

**Draft/Published System:**
- Events **with images** ‚Üí `published: true` (appear on website)
- Events **without images** ‚Üí `published: false` (saved as drafts)
- Image enhancement automatically promotes drafts to published

#### Data Quality Features

**Automatic Venue Enrichment:**
- Complete venue database with phone, website, address
- Automatic enrichment from known Sandpoint venues
- Proper venue object structure with all required fields

**Date/Time Validation:**
- Detects evening events with morning timestamps
- Catches default parsing errors (midnight with specific times)
- Flags events with description/time mismatches for review

**Duplicate Prevention:**
- Intelligent deduplication by event ID and date
- Allows recurring events on different dates
- Stable ID generation for consistent tracking

## üìä Data Flow & File Structure

### Production Data Locations
- **Production Events**: `data/merged-events/events.json`
- **Review Events**: `data/events-to-review.json`
- **Upload Reports**: `sanity-upload-report.json`

### Key Processing Files
- **`utils/eventMerger.js`** - Main pipeline orchestrator, deduplication, venue enrichment
- **`utils/eventNormalizer.js`** - Schema normalization, data quality validation
- **`utils/intelligentTextParser.js`** - Converts unstructured text to complete JSON
- **`utils/sanityUploader.js`** - Upload utility module (imported by upload script)
- **`upload-events-to-sanity.js`** - Main upload script with detailed reporting

### Intelligent Review System

Events are automatically flagged for manual review when:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Date/time mismatches detected (e.g., evening events with morning timestamps)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Venue information is missing or incomplete
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Image download fails
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Event data structure is questionable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Price extraction fails or returns invalid values

Flagged events go to `data/events-to-review.json` for manual verification before production.

## üèóÔ∏è Development Structure

### Key Directories
- `components/` - React components (EventCard, EventDetail, Navbar, etc.)
- `pages/` - Next.js pages and API routes
- `scrapers/` - Event scrapers for different sources
